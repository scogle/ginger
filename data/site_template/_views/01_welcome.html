<p>Ginger is a utility for quickly generating data-driven static sites.  It's intended for journalists, scientists, analysts and others who work with json data to quickly create displays.</p>

<p>The goal is to go from data to display in as little time as possible, while still being flexible enough for refinements and improvements.</p>

<h3>What Ginger Isn't</h3>

<p>Ginger isn't going to be great for creating complex visualizations or interactive displays.  It probably isn't going to be a great solution for big, complex projects that require lots of intircate template features either.  Ginger is just meant as a handy tool for <b>quickly</b> turning data into displays.</p>

<p>That being said, feel free to hack away at the layouts and data loader script if you want to do something that isn't supported out of the box.  If anything breaks beyond repair, just run <code>ginger new</code> in a new directory and copy your <code>_config.yaml</code>, <code>_views</code> and <code>_data</code> over to start fresh!</p>

<p>To edit what you see here, modify these sections or create new ones in the <code>_views</code> folder.  Views are a combination of instructions about where to get data and a little bit of template code to tell Ginger how to display it.  Take a look at the section below (and its view file) to get a better idea for how views work.</p>
