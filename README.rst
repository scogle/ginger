NOT EVEN CLOSE TO WORKING YET

ginger is a utility to generate static data site quickly

Usage
-----

A typical workflow looks like:

* mkdir myGingerSite

* cd myGingerSite

* ginger new

This will generate the structure of your site -- a _config.yml file, a _views folder and a _site folder where the built site will go.

To rebuild after changes, run 'ginger build'

'ginger serve' will serve the site on a simple HTTP server
